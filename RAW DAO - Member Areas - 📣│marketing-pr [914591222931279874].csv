It also occurred to me that the word proposal could mean different things. A proposal to me is a simple standard or an introduction to their company and their approach for our brand mark (logo) along with a bid. It is up to each designer / agency how much they want to put into their proposal to land the job. We are not asking for any design work for free unless they choose to add sketches but that will not be in our creative brief to them. So maybe instead of proposal it is a introduction from them to us and why we should work with them. Hope that makes since. I am not advocating for free work from fellow artist.

We had such a brutal year, work-wise – and we really need to close down the studio around X-mas, for a break.

- most of the time when I met a project that set publicly that his goal was to increase the value of the token/NFT/etc they looked like a cash grab in the best case or a rug pull in the worst; this is also how the majority of NFT projects look like today (copycats, no clear path / value for the community, etc)
- people love to be part in something bigger than them, visionaries, they are not advertising how much money they will make from their visions/inventions - but they do a lot of money by bringing value. between ""I want to make more money"" and ""I want to change the world"" I think the latter is more powerful

1) we can go barebones - pay for official logo development, just to give us some unity across platforms, but past that we maintain a low profile, no big brand, just focus on the work at hand and have a couple of internally managed social media profiles to connect w the outside world.

2) we can push to get a full brand strategy developed, including identity, logo, brand story, vision, brand positioning, brand voice and consistency, etc

if we go with option 2, which is kind of what it sounds like the community wants to do -- we should do it right. go through the full process, send out RFP's to a variety of agencies, set up conversations with each to really get a common understanding of what we feel our brand represents so that they can do quality work, and then pick a final agency and work collaboratively over a few months to really develop a brand that represents us as well as a website that can act as the external facing communication channel, particularly for non-web3 folks","",""

Sorry to keep you hanging on for a full weekend – but we needed some time to really check our schedule, and see if we could fit in one extra project before the end of the year.

However – looking at the schedule, we came to the conclusion we won’t manage to do that.
We’re very sorry.

We had such a brutal year, work-wise – and we really need to close down the studio around X-mas, for a break.
So we’re basically planning to work until December 20 – and then call it a day, and close down until January.

And we don’t think we’ll manage to come up with a full graphic identity in those two weeks before Dec. 20. 
We’re sorry.

Again, our apologies for keeping you waiting so long for an answer.
And we hope (in fact, we are sure) that you’ll find another suitable studio for this project!

All the best,
and have a good week,

Danny, Marieke, Erwin,

Seems like we should pick a basic approach: throw ideas into the channel and narrow down to pick something, or get proposals from different groups/designers. If the former, we can keep the free for all going and save the time of people getting proposals etc. If the latter, let’s wait for that process and probably put a small committee in place to take referrals from the community, vet submissions and proposals, and share the top viable proposals with the community for a vote… right now it seems like a bunch of individuals running in different directions 😬","",""

2) Style/Ethos - key points that we want to capture in our brand. Style, ethos, mission, vision, etc.

3) Budget - this goes hand in hand with #1, but we should determine our ultimate budget here. 

IMO, once we land on those, we should consider appointing an individual or a small group of individuals to lead this initiative as project leads.

For context I was a graphic / UXUI designer / design director for 20 years working for many major international brands. Went to RISD, bla, bla, bla. First off I’ll say that the ‘design by committee’ route never works and always produces sub par work that no one in the end is happy with. I’d also advocate to not rush the design and just use straight type for the identity in the meantime as opposed to a quick fix. I like the idea of running an internal contest along side a pitch from external designers / small studios, however in my experience not many professional designers / studios (at least the good ones) are interested in unpaid pitch projects, nor is it respectful of their time. I also would not solely run an internal contest unless we have a number of qualified designers here that have produced quality identity work. Otherwise you run into the ‘microcosm effect’ where by the options you have to choose from are only as good as the pool of talent you’re drawing from and those options may be sub par to what you’d get if you had a more qualified pool.","",""
"624685602692005939","travisrogers#2611","2021-12-13","I’d also suggest structuring the request for both cases to avoid a random Discord feed full of off-the-cuff ideas that everyone feels like they have to vote on with emojis. The proposed directions should be created in a way that’s well thought out and considered. A contest and or RFP should have submission requirements like presentation format and a deadline. Typically a designer will create at least 3 directions to be considered as a first round to be refined over at least another 2 rounds of revisions. For an internal contest we wouldn’t need for everyone to produce a number of concepts, but there should be a specified format that everyone’s work is submitted in so that it’s properly presented to be judged. As well, to aid the focus of the submitted directions, an organization will usually write up a creative brief to help communicate their vision / goals in order to draw from when developing identity options. This doesn’t have to be exhaustive and can even be a short paragraph, but is a good anchor to focus everyone’s effort as they work on a mark.","",""

For instance, not all decisions can/should be made by committee (popular example: design by committee). 

I think people hear DAO and think, everything is a vote. When in reality that could never work. Thats why we outsource our voice to credible people in the community. 

For example DT has been a founding member of multiple DAOs with valuations over $100M. I would gladly delegate my vote to him for things around governance and finance, because he clearly is more credible and has more experience than I do. Just like I would delegate my vote to Justin or Freddie when it comes to a curatorial decision.

The agreement that this matter was going to be handled in a centralized way, would have been helpful to know over a week ago - a lot of dialogue and effort would have been saved. 

Otherwise, I think an appropriate vote would have been a) emoji for a logo, b) commission a logo, c) design a logo in discord with everyone. Fwiw I only think one of those is a good idea, but a quick open decision would have been an easy next step. I guess I could have more formally proposed that vote, and now I know… but I’m not going to counter-propose a separate vote from yours at this point.

We need to prove we can create a community that collects and get people excited about photography, because the real mission is to grow the photography NFT space and make it a relevant part of the market.

"819708932876140575","shanelavalette#2830","2021-12-13","Throwing this out there, based on everything I'm hearing here...

What if we don't make an emoji into a temporary RAW logo and instead leave or rotate the image we have on Discord and Twitter until there is a website and graphic identity developed in tandem? We already have a temporary solution in place.

We can update those images or the Twitter banner periodically to showcase works from the collection in the meantime and credit the artists in the Twitter bio and on Discord. Yes, that means no formal logo/lockup yet, but certainly these images from the collection are stronger placeholders than any emoji will be. 

This also actually takes the least amount of conversation/work from the larger group right now and enables the process that was already underway with just a handful of the marketing/pr folks, including @michelleviljoen.eth and @charlierubin, who were taking a lead on some potential design directions for the DAO to consider. (See Notion). They can help define the needs for a logo/identity and website for showcasing the collection and information about RAW (which will be an obvious and necessary asset) and then see what kind of price and timeline we'd be looking at to get a simple version of what we need and want in place. Then we launch a website and graphic identity for RAW in tandem, when it's ready. Doesn't need to be crazy expensive in either currency or time, just well done. If the firm is too pricey, go with an independent designer that has a solid folio. Easy. A reasonable goal should be early in the new year.

We can operate without either of those things (logo, website) in the very short term. We know this because we are doing it right now. But, ultimately, I'm with the bunch that feels it makes sense to get it right the first time and come out of the gate strong with a website and identity as thoughtful as the collecting that RAW aspires to. Even if it's lo-fi, fast-tracked, or simple, these kinds of things are still worth doing with intention. I think I wrote it before in this thread... Measure twice, cut once.","","🔥 (12)"

I agree that it’s less important in Web3 but it’s still vital that what we create is 💯 own-able, does not have any visual connection to existing brands, and is easily recognizable as RAW. 

@shanelavalette suggestion is great, and it would give us time to do a proper brand dive and presentation formation with reverts. That’s how we’ve always worked. I’m more than happy to get my team on this brief but as we need to conscious of my teams time and capacity a RFP / basic brief would be great we can then come back with a proposal for both costs and timelines (we can get these from a couple of designers and decide on which to go with. - again this doesn’t have to be crazy expensive at all as it can be a simple brand which we can build and expand on as we go forward - but then that expansion needs to come from a core team so that we don’t end up with a butchered brand regardless 😆

Efforts have been lead by @0xSam and we have CV architects lined up and at least two different options of land that will fit our needs. There are other parts to our ambitions in the metaverse and irl intersections in the future, but for now the priority is to secure the parcels and gallery so the work can start for us to have our growing collection displayed in CV and OnCyber in the shortest term possible. Here is a draft in Clarity of the budget we are estimating for this first stage https://app.clarity.so/rawdao/view/006f9ce2-a26e-417d-b1e9-eb7b60a52e09.

But I suppose selling the parcels and 'moving' is always an option for CV, just a risk if there's a big exodus that causes the value to drop or not be able to liquidate. I know CV has a good foothold in the space so far and lots of use cases.

We may also be able to find a friend of the DAO or a DAO member with a plenty of existing space they could donate or rent for say a year to test the waters and see if it's a good fit for RAW and the social activities mentioned. Has this already been explored? Maybe they'd like some RAW tokens for a year rental? 

In any event, is there a way to uncast my vote in Snapshot for now? Might need to vote neither yes or no on this one since I'm really in the middle and at the end of the day trust in the rest of the DAO to make the call and develop a thoughtful gallery in either CV, OnCyber, or both!","",""

- to say ""as a CV parcel is an NFT, that purely as an investment it is very risky"", in a DAO whose scope is to onboard people in the NFT area... to me, this doesn't make too much sense; RAW is buying NFTs, is promoting NFTs as ""the next big thing"" and I don't see why ""our"" NFTs are less risky than ""their"" NFTs.

- given the last year and the start of 2022, any investment in the metaverse seems like a great idea; for profit only, for building stuff, doesn't matter - everybody is praising metaverse companies and their future; unless we're thinking this is the top?

- if we think short-term nothing looks impressive, not even RAW; do we really want to look at this as a short-term investment? not keen on spending 20+ eth on metaverse space, but if we're in a decision like bitcoin in 2013 or eth in 2016?... 

- given the number of +/- comments I would also suggest to give it more time before voting; not to get unanimity, but to allow more opinions to be expressed and discussed.","","👍 (1)"

We thought from an investment standpoint, having connected parcels are usually good investments which have proven over an over. We wanted a parcels with large open space, rather than tall and skinny, as the work better for gallery displays.  2) compensation depends on performance and it includes us helping build, and add the art to the gallery and upkeep. This is something that has been done with Fingerprints. Also sometimes the building becomes more expensive if we add more things and then that extra costs comes from the compensation budget. It goes to scouting for parcels, negotiating them (we’ve been negotiating for the past month and sellers are being difficult cause of the current market), getting good and experienced builders, managing the build and ensure that the vision of the gallery comes to life, helping build. Curating the art that goes on the gallery since the builders don’t do that, and the continuous curation and changes of these. The builders gave us  1 eth discount due to the relationship we have with them so there a lot of small things that go untouched but end up adding up","","💯 (2),🔥 (3)"

Last I heard @michelleviljoen.eth  was looking into her firm as well as Envelope Services, for proposals. It was implied we might hear something around now, in the new year, but no update from them yet. Any news, Mich?  

And everyone agreed to, in the meantime, rotate RAW collection images on social (enjoying that on Twitter!)... and roll out a proper ""identity"" along with a RAW website (in tandem). That would be ideal. 

Love the shape/photo/light reference of Carlo's image—reminds me a lot of the design proposal I made too with similar thinking in mind... https://discord.com/channels/908059371718709288/914591222931279874/921977230920400896

Always happy to revisit that lockup if necessary, or just cheer on this new direction instead.
