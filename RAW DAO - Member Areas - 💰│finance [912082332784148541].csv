the way dune.xyz works is that the entire ethereum blockchain is available on it using SQL, and so you can query it directly via their web app and create dashboards on top of your query results.
if you click the title of a chart, it will reveal to your the underlying query.
ideally we build something similar for RAW.

I have two observations. The buffer is quite large I would say and in addition I don't really understand the relative large value of the compensation in eth. Surely you can do most of this with raw tokens?  It is very likely that the price will rise well in the coming year.
There is a postive upside for both sides. With a greater focus on the raw token, there is more budget available for the purchase of new works. And there is a positive relationship if the work of the dao is done well and the token price rises.
As an example, currently as a curator of the jenny dao I am rewarded purely in jenny tokens. I am very satisfied with this. This also works very well with bankless.","","👍 (3),ToadYes (1)"

We all know Fingerprints has been presenting an amazing performance since its inception and now with the creation of RAW. 
Of course as the creator and main tokenholder of RAW, Fingerprints will reap the benefits of our growth and performance. But wouldn’t it be nice if we could benefit from Fingerprints performance as well? Why not use just a portion of the “Other uses” budget to acquire a stake in Fingerprints?

#14 - Transactional relationship with other DAOs

This is very exciting the read through. Of course, i wish Obscura was tokenized already, but this is a ways out, and not that simple. The Obscura community likely has the largest spread of $RAW of any other DAO. 

Would love to expand some ideas on how we can best collaborate and support each other into the future, as i know RAW collected a Foundry pass etc and we have so much member crossover and similar views on photography in this space.","","👏 (5),💯 (1)"
