If we try to do this, we will slowly create a possibility a bit of resentment as to why they are not being collected, because why would they be here if not to be seen and bought?! This happens in many discord where all it becomes is people dumping images to see if they get picked. RAwDao will be scouting for those photographers anyway. The New Community photography collection will have that role, to scout for new talent from inside the NFT space. So do we need a community of photographers? If we do, which would be great let‚Äôs help them with building a community about sharing ideas. Just be mindful about this. 

RAwDao is about building a community around the power of a collection. We are sending signals that we are a group of sophisticated thinkers that, like FP, have a very very very clear vision of the power of photography. The taste and efficacy of our curation is what will create the community! If we build that, all eyes will be on us. If we are sloppy, we will just attract people looking for ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù to dump their stuff on our collection. If we build a really strong collection, the best talent will rally behind us and help us fulfill our mission of being the best photography collection in the world. Again, the collection is the community. We have a perfect collection like FP, everyone will come to us.

"817469690347257877","alexcartagenamex#4215","2021-11-15","**A PROPOSAL FOR RAW DAO‚Äôs 
CURATORIAL VISION**


INTRODUCTION

In the newly born NFT artworld, photography has been gaining popularity since the success of Justin Aversano‚Äôs Twin Flames in the early 2021. Since then, a wave of photographers have taken over the space with relative success taking advantage of a crescent interest in collectors for high quality photographic work. But the space lacks a history of the art and clear markers of what is and has been considered valuable in photography historically, creating uncertainty in photography as a long term investment. Until now, photography has served principally 2 purposes, one is as a collectible easy to flip because of its current popularity, the other as a collectible that the collector simply ‚Äúlikes‚Äù for personal visual/emotional reasons. The true historical and social value of a photo-work has not been taken into account in a serious way yet in a broad sense and to make a healthy environment of creation and collection of photography as an art, a signal has to be made to cut through the current noise and to help point to quality work being produced inside the NFT world as well as in the traditional artworld.

The RAW DAO‚Äôs curatorial mission in the NFT space is to create a strong signal of what‚Äôs considered a quality photographic work of the highest standards in a historical context while also acknowledging the new photographic movement emerging from within the space from the interaction of creators and collectors. For this purpose, the RAW DAO‚Äôs vault will hold two collections, The Legacy Collection and The New Community Photography Collection:","",""
"817469690347257877","alexcartagenamex#4215","2021-11-15","**The Legacy Collection**:
Will be conformed of collected works by established artists in the traditional artworld with the objective of creating a record of high quality and historically valuable art photography that can help as a guide for the community of what‚Äôs considered important photography as art, to this purpose, the curatorial committee will take into account established artists that are already onboarded in the NFT world and also artists that can be considered for onboarding with the purpose of adding work from them to the collection.

**The New Community Photography Collection**:
Will be formed of photographic work that is considered important by the community itself as a way to give voice to the values of this evolving community that we call the NFT world. The community curatorial committee will take into account work that‚Äôs already in important collections of the NFT artworld and work that has been important for the short history of photography in the NFT space without discrimination of style, concept or formal approach . This collection will also be on the lookout for new work being produced and valued in the NFT world by creators and collectors alike and will have the objective of creating a record of the evolution of photography in this space, a collection that can become a marker for new cultural aesthetic values.


CONCLUSION.

These two collections will help gather the best photographic work being created as NFTs, both from established artists from the traditional artworld in an effort of honoring the history of the photographic art and from new artists being valued by the community for sharing a vision with it towards different themes through their photographic art as a way to support and push forward new and different ways of understanding photography as an art and as a form of social communication.","","üíØ (4),heart (1),omg (1)"

I would like to understand however in which order are these collections going to be built and how they will be prioritized. I understand the value of the Legacy collection. However, my concern is that starting by collecting work that is not yet part of the  NFT ecosystem is sending the signal to collectors that  the ""quality work""  is still outside of the space.  While Justin's success was groundbreaking indeed, there were and have been simultaneously many of us in the space, working hard for visibility of photography in the space altogether.  This to say that I believe both collections should be built simultaneously and if anything the community collection should lead the way as a way to honor the work of folks who have been working from within the space.","",""

I think amongst (emerging) photographers there might be the expectation that being in the Dao equals being collected by the Dao. I can feel that being part of the anxiety of those who can not currently afford full membership. We need to decouple this.

Re the two different collections I have a remark about the semantics. I would talk about Important photography. Full stop. (including but not limited to photography as art) e.g. if we had Robert Capa's D-Day images as NFTs no one would argue that that doesn't belong in the RAW collection. So would Tianmen Tank Man.

I am of course breaking a lance here for ""old fashioned"" documentary. We may or may not call it art but historical importance cannot be denied.","","üíØ (1),‚úÖ (3),‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

Also the current problems signalled in the NFT photo space are real and need to be addressed in order for photo NFT to have a future in the long run and in order to establish connection with the traditional photo world. 

What I am missing a bit though is how RAWdao acquires liquidity in the future. With the funds coming out of the PartyBid liquidity will be guaranteed for quite some time, but not forever.

How will new funds be raised for the DAO? There will be some value derived from the RAW tokens through appreciation. There will be value in the NFTs in the DAOs vault, but will RAWdao trade them? And if so, how will be decided what and when they are to be traded? There is a risk RAWdao will be flipping NFT in the same way as currently is the speculative practice, which might undo part of RAWs purpose. 

Already with the PartyBid strategy to establish liquidity RAW is walking a thin line in this respect - though I must add it is conceptually fantastic to fracture this historic work to a thousand owners in a way returning the work in the ownership of the community. Don‚Äôt know if that is intentional though, but this concept of shared ownership of important work might also be a strategy for the future - it fits web3 philosophy.

1- primary token sales: we still have a huge amount of tokens in treasury which we can sell to raise funds;
2- capital raises: for instance, from venture capital funds interested in investing in web3.0
3- revenue generating projects: where we can, for example, create new nft projects in partnership with artists and retain a portion of the proceeds from the initial sales and secondary royaltee fees
4- other initiatives we don't anticipate, such as artistic events and exhibitions where we can perhaps earn from ticket sales or a number of things we haven't thought about.","",""

Many of you might have seen on twitter that Braydon @nft_papi encountered great misfortune and lost a lot of precious NFTs to fucking hackers. Don't want to go into that other then that I consider Braydon a pillar in the nFT community and esp photography. I hold a weekly spaces with him where we try to shine the light on lesser known photogs slugging it out. I think he is a great host and promoter. So I want to reach out to our group here and see if there's a way we might ease the pain a bit. I know Braydon wanted to join RAW but certainly now it's out of the question. 
Long story short: Is there a way we can get him a membership, doesn't have to be founding artist but a regular membership (in other words 500RAW tokens?) Just dropping it here, cause I think we gotta look out for our own if we can.","","üíØ (2),üòî (1)"

We have the opportunity to do both:
A) Identify historically important traditional photographers who may not even know what an NFT is, and help them onboard their work into a Web3 modality
B) Identify influential photographers who may have already dabbled in NFTs, and help them refine their Web3 strategy and expand their work to a wider audience.

This is heavily inspired by Fingerprints' organizational design which has worked wonders for us in the last few months. It is desirable to tackle this early so we have a structure for division of labor, performance measurement and, later on, compensation of members.

It will also help to structure our discord channels.

Please take a look and see if it makes sense to you, if it is too complex, or missing something important.

We'll get on to curation structure right after this, I apologize for mixing up the order of our roadmap a little bit, it just felt to me that this might be easier/simpler to approve fast.","",""

1) Curated Collection Committee 
Testing period: 4 weeks, after that voting to decide new members
- Number of Members: 3 @Founding Artists + 7 collectors (initial formation)
- Budget: 120 ETH (e.g.15% of our treasury)
Committee role / responsibilities: 
(i) get nominations from members/community in a dedicated channel, on a weekly basis
(ii) decide to collect or not 
(iii) decide acquisition strategy, size, timing and etc.
(iv) provide feedback (Y / N) to the community and why 
(v) try to come with a standard short memo to compare one collection / artist with others / previous discussed cases
(vi) interact with marketing team / external relation to announce the acquisition after it is executed. 

Curated Artists will gain a special role in our discord after we acquire. 

2) Community Collection
To come in 4 weeks, we should wait to get a better sense of interactions with new members

good start, much to unpack here from this list. ill keep it brief-ish.

(i) can we elaborate on this a bit? what goes into making a nomination? there are going to be 300+ members ""nominating"" i may end up looking like a shill channel. i think we need to determine a format nominations must adhere by, and limit the amount of messages and individual can send here in a given period of time. How does said committee decide on if something gets collected or not? some basic guidelines around the rules of the committee would be beneficial. How many works is a particular committee allowed to bring in from the madness of nominations?
     -on this note, **frontrunning has not been mentioned at all**. we are a prime target for this. this should be a discussion topic in our meeting. this is consideration for members of the committee too, not just members. 

I think we should discuss a clear process for nominating the next round of the committee

i agree with @glory here that this is a serious amount of ETH the deploy for the first committee, does this amount need to be so large? Intentionality should be considered for works collected, this is a challenge with such a blanket amount of work imo that can be collected by 120 ETH. Do we have limitation for ETH spent on works? How can we decide this? 

there is a lot to consider here. are we just looking at this in notion, or editing it collectively?

a few scattered thoughts: **founding member channel would be nice. (collector members should have founder role too)**","",""

"746551601296179231","DT | Luiz#4149","2021-11-24","Ok I have a few thoughts, since it looks like the discussion is straying away from the main point.

**At this initial stage, the only chance RAW has to make an impact on the world, engage membership, grow its token value and eventually be in a position to raise more funds is to collect work that will go up in value**

That doesn‚Äôt mean we collect ANY work that goes up in value. That doesn‚Äôt mean we have no curatorial perspective. But that does mean some aspirations like quotas, collecting outside of platforms or chains that are where the serious collectors collect, supporting friends, have to be contained. 

**Our biggest risk is irrelevance**

I liked the initial proposal by @hddamico because it skews in favor of collectors. We have plenty of photographers in the space, and the simple fact we exist with such a rich treasury will be beneficial to them. 

But the deal for collector is still unclear. It‚Äôs far from obvious that photography is a market that they should be spending their time and money. It‚Äôs part of our mission to show them the way.

If we hold ourselves too early to utopian ideas of supporting far and wide we don‚Äôt make an impact. 

My suggestions would be to make a few concentrated bets on the beginning, **fast**, on photographers that have quality and are already relatively validated by the current market. Then, we can start to think a bit more outside the box and spread our bets, eventually getting to a point where we‚Äôre able to deploy capital we don‚Äôt expect a short term return.

If we try to do everything from day one we increase our chances of failing. That would really be a shame.","","üëç (13),fplogoglitched (2),ü§ù (1),YES (1),üíØ (1),catJAM (2)"

Are we thinking of making committees fir curation? 

I'm hearing people saying members will vote for 365 photos plus votes for curated collection. This is an impossible task. It will drain the community

In another hand, I'm seeing a lit of people very eager to place their work on the community collection. I'm not a photographer but want be part of the DAO, because of what we can do together for nft photography. I would be very disappointed if people use the DAO as a stepping stone to get known.

With degens in read-only subs, we might see some sudden spikes in collection sales based on speculation -  before RAW have even made any decisions - causing us to reconsider whats said in here.

Also, privacy of DAO members - to be able to express freely amongst fully aligned and paying members feels like a safe space - being watched by 'read-only' members will make me uncomfortable personally","","üíØ (7)"

It's like when Nickelodeon moved their offices to universal studios and put in glass walls so the public could just gawk at them all day. It was awful. Employees lost motivation and felt scared and nothing was private. It makes everyone watch their words and actions a lot more and less progress is made. 

Also, you make a great point about front running, it seems like that would be the primary reason for wanting to see what we were doing.

we are still ironing it out, and working with customers (like you) to do it.

the main issue we‚Äôve heard with typical saas pricing is that it is unfair to daos who have a more fluid structure. per person per month just doesnt work.

the other issue is that you want people to have access to notes and/or the wiki but it would be too much to bill for all of those folks.

so the idea we have is to charge per user per day that they are active. and only charge for users who participate in the core project management functionality. bc they are the ones who are actually doing the work for the dao. this would include the core team, and also any part-time contributors who interact with projects or bounties.""*","",""

"710331213549797416","Seth üî≤ ¬≤#8330","2021-12-27","Regarding governance, we must have a serious discussion on the tradeoffs we‚Äôre willing to make. 

First, regarding centralized decision making authority. Less decision makers means faster decisions, but also carries risks inherent to all centralization. Additionally certain decisions are too urgent to be put to community wide votes, and different types of voting mechanisms can and should be used for different decisions that need to be made. 

Second, regarding the form of centralization. Do we want a committee? Do we want delegates? If the answer is no to both, then we need to think of ways to create an engaged voting body. A pool of RAW could be set aside just for this purpose. Voters could be positively incentivized with raw (ie if you vote you get raw or if you vote several times in a row you get raw). Alternatively they could be negatively incentivized (less voting or manipulation of voting process results in slashing their share of that RAW pool).

Third, salaries. If we do end up having individuals dedicated to governance, what should they be paid? Should they be paid at all? That‚Äôs another discussion in and of itself.

Fourth, there are creative options beyond a centralized core team/delegates or incentives for all when it comes to voting. There could be several individuals whose responsibility is to herd/shepherd voters, like a ‚Äúwhip‚Äù in the US Congress. Again the same discussion around salary would emerge.","","üî• (3)"
