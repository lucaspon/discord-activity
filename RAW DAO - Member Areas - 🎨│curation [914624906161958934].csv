Based on my current experience, the valuation for Twin Flames is then not even really overvalued.I compare it mainly to generative art, because I believe that photography should be at least equivalent to generative art.

These are some suggestions and ideas I have:
1: involving top photographers from the classic photography world. I would be very happy if we could convince a Martin Parr, Anton Corbijn or Erwin Olaf to sell an nft to RAW. 
2: otc deals with the big photographers within the nft world. Can we offer them raw tokens? Then we have win win. Good marketing for them and for us at a low cost.... Is that an idea? 
3: Develop strong partnerships with agencies like Magnum, Panos Pictures, L'Agence VU and help them market nft pieces. Again, a win-win situation.
4: guiding and developing emerging artists.

As we mentioned in the call, we're looking to create a proposal for how the Community Collection will be created. The idea of the Community Collection was formed in response to the movement in NFT photography. RAW.DAO has created this collection to acquire strong works in this space, voted by RAW.DAO members. 

Couple things we need to think about:

1) Nomination of artists/works - how do we do this?
2) How do we settle on a final few? How do we vote on those?
3) Creating a budget for acquisition and a time period to use the funds
4) Voting timelines and how often we vote on works/artists
5) What kind of photography are we looking to collect? 

Myself and @RobinFriend will be brainstorming some ideas but I would really love to hear from members and get your thoughts as we prepare the proposal! Let's aim to have a rough draft by Thursday next week.","","üíØ (24),üëç (15)"

- Increase diversity of total RAW Holdings
- Ground up discovery as a counter force to Top Down Curation

Potential Problems
- Shilling
- Too many options
- Voting Fatigue
- Insiders front running the DAO

Budget
- Community curation budget will be 1/6 that of the Curation Committee Budget

Compiling Collections
- Anyone can propose a collection.
- As an individual you can propose only one collection. 
- No more than 3 projects for one single artists can be proposed per month. 

Voting Mechanics
Round 1
- Votes will happen on the same week of every month (open for 7 days). 
- After the initial list has been made, you have 3 votes. 
- You cannot vote for the collection/artist you nominated.

Round 2
- Votes will happen be over the course of the week following the first round
- Much smaller sub-set of initial collections and artists.
- Top 3 collections will win the vote
- Purchases will be made immediately after the vote ends, to avoid front running.","","üî• (2)"

"392816751118909463","b_themouth#0088","2021-12-04","I just been reading some ideas here. As I stated before being completely decentralized doesnt work. My opinion is going forward we should have a committee elected by everyone. On that commitee we can have seats for the founding members, seats for outside specialists and setas from the community. That way everyone can feel represented and the committee can be changed every quarter or 6 months. This way you have people interested in working, focusing on the project and need to show results. The community will have a say on the results and decide if vote for the same committee  or not. 

Going in detail about the curation one, if the committee is unanimous on choosing a photo that photo doesnt go down for the community to vote. If there is doubts on the committee, the vote comes down to community and can go for a major vote to be included or not. 

There are advantages and disadvantages with this model but this will make everyone being represented. Community members can apply for the pro position, for community position, for curator positions. Once voted they can work in a small group to increase productivity. When in doubt, everyone has a say. 

Maybe this post would make more sense in #governance but we are in the beginning so makes sense in both channels. This type of DAO organization is Pod structure we can have different pods thats are responsible for different areas of the DAO.","",""

I've compiled our initial ""Version 0"" proposal for the Community Collection on the discussion we've had here so far. There's been many different ideas so I've done my best to bring an element of each into this proposal.

I ask that everyone take a look at this document and, **instead of editing it directly, please write comments down in Notion. ** After this we can work on another draft in more detail. This is just to get the ball rolling and keep us focused.

While I think it is obvious and important to collect those already in the space I agree with one of the comments that @Klamt made: to support **new and native** photographers. RAW has an opportunity to facilitate great photographers' entrance into the space and, in doing so, we are contributing to the growth of the community and given the chance to collect work that has already proven to be important/successful (likely at a relative discount too since they would be newer to the NFT space). How we would do this would obviously need to be discussed but in general I think that with a small budget allocation we could invest in researching, recruiting, and helping to launch successful photographers interested in making the leap to nfts.

I created a couple of RAWDAO queries in my dashboard https://dune.xyz/mmiliszkiewicz/RDAO:

- $RAW in vault
- $RAW in holders hands
- Total number of members votes
- Table that shows for each member (except vault): number of tokens and a number of votes (where 1 vote is 500 tokens).
Maybe some of these metrics might be helpful when thinking about the voting process - for example the table shows numbers of votes for each member (where 1 vote is 500 tokens).

I think we need revisit what the purpose of the community collection is. At its core, it's an experiment. To see if there is big upside in the knowledge of crowds. We can be confident that super successful collectors/whales/artists are 100% tuned into this space, but less confident that 300 voices (many of which with conflicts of interest) can make highly informed and cohesive purchase decision. 

There are A LOT of holes we can poke in this concept, and many ways to take advantage as an individual. Despite that I think it‚Äôs worth a shot. Keep the potential losses small, and iterate quickly.","",""

There is the community backing the ETH, and the community behind the photos.

So maybe we could just ponder not acting like whales slurping stuff up at any price (not implying our curators did so in these cases). It¬¥s also in the act of collecting that we create value. Not only following the hype  but also scanning the rough edges and collecting outliers as well as mainstreamers might be a way.

It is not magic, but actual openness from both sides to find common ground. Art has been inscribed in a paradigm of **""it is just culture and art""** but let¬¥s reflect on that. Who benefits from that most? Not the artists. It is the institutions that live from selling, exhibiting and commercializing the work of the artists that don¬¥t have a salary like the Museum employees. Everyone wins in that **""art as culture""** ecosystem except the artists themselves. This has been my case for 15 years. This is one of the values of this space, it is that now we are, as artists, some kind of ""currency"": we are contemporary alchemists that with our ideas and work, can actually create value out of ideas. The system as it is outside is very restrictive, even for people like me with 5 galleries and with works in many museums. The NFT space offers a balance. I run Obscura and the commissions we offer for artists to make new work could have been double in amount, but I was emphatic to my co founders that that would have been unhealthy for IRL photographers to get paid so much money. We want the market to pay fair value for work and if the work is deserving, win more money after there is actual proof of work and value. Ideas on this?","","üíØ (12)"

"817469690347257877","alexcartagenamex#4215","2021-12-11","Hey Chavi. This has been a discussion from day 0 in the DAO. I come from a Contemporary Art space where the value of a body of work (a collection in NFT terms) gains value because of several codes: Aesthetic, conceptual, technical, historical, medium proposition (experimental) and personal story but usually the least important. The proof is in the pudding, in the images themselves saying what they need to say more than what is trying to ""back"" the work. Value then is seen when the work checks many of these aspects. So when I brought many of these ideas to the forum there were many push backs that these should be not considered as there is photography at large that does not abide by these codes (adventure photography, fashion, wild life, etc etc). So we left aside these parameters and decided to collect ""Photography"" in the broadest of senses. This creates pros and cons. More people that do photography can be included in the collection, but it is a bit more difficult to argument ""why"" it is valuable. Experimental work like you are suggesting resides in both the contemporary photography realm but also in the fine art craft realm. Both are valuable but the price tags tend to differ from one to another. All this to say, RawDao is going through the process of understanding what to collect and that is the nature of building a collection. We should be lenient to some extent while the ""taste"" forms. These things take time and a lot of work, which I can attest the curation committee is doing everyday through discussions and asking difficult questions to understand what we are doing.","","‚úåüèª (6),üëç (8),üíØ (3)"

Personally, I have a very expansive view of ""photography"" as a medium and as a curator have enjoyed exploring this, as I see photographic work intersecting with various other mediums in exciting ways. I love traditional 'documentary' work and 'straight' photography that is a part of the canon of history of course, but also love artists that push the language and materiality of the medium and maintain conceptual practices that may alter my understanding of what photography can be. Check out *Photography as Contemporary Art* and *Photography is Magic* by Charlotte Cotton for a great primer. Or a book I edited called *Lay Flat 02: Meta*, which includes many artists reflecting on the medium itself through their work. I've curated exhibitions by photographers in the past that include video works that connect to their photographic works, and that's actually a fairly common practice for contemporary artists working with photography. You may also see artists that work sculpturally but whose work is very photographic (ex. Letha Wilson), artists that toy with chemical processes and abstraction (ex. Alison Rossiter), that work with AI or generative processes, that work with moving image, etc. In other words, I love seeing artists working on the 'fringes' of what we might consider to be photographic. I'd be thrilled to see an embrace of that at RAW, or a subset of the collection that is more experimental in that regard. That said, this doesn't mean RAW will feel that way as it's up to the curators and all members collectively to help define the parameters for this photographic collection as we move forward. üôÇ","","üëèüèª (13),üî• (3),üíØ (3)"

"819708932876140575","shanelavalette#2830","2021-12-12","Haha! I suppose this all depends on how you'd like to define photography and how 'traditional' you'd like to be about that. It's important to keep in mind that ""the"" history of photography that we think of more truthfully ""a"" history‚Äîfull of problematic tropes and imbalances, blindspots, etc. That history is being rewritten in important ways as we speak and in recent decade the confines of the 'photographic' have also expanded in exciting ways. 

In simple terms, photography is **the art or practice of taking and processing photographs**  or maybe even more basic, it's **recording with light**. Often artists do all kinds of various things with those light recordings, from early alt processes to modern technological interventions, photoshop, modern printing techniques, digital outputs, sculptures, websites, installations, moving images, books, now NFTs‚Äîall tools/technology/vehicles to create with.

I'll say this... More and more *photographic artists* are working in interdisciplinary ways and using photography as a tool to express as needed. Photography has always fought for a seat at the table in the art world, and in many ways just embracing the camera or image-making techniques as this tool for making art is, in my eyes, the way to think about it. Especially in a moment where we are image-saturated and cameras are so accessible, making great images is not as much of a challenge... but making resonant art is. This involves embedding more depth in those images, forming complex relationship between them, and pushing the medium in innovative ways. There isn't a need to confine to a particular type of print or 'output' either, in my eyes. 

Food for thought! But again, I trust in the curatorial committee and the members of this DAO to have conversations like this and shape RAW's collection accordingly.","","üëè (8),üíØ (4),fplogoglitched (3)"

I would love to see us also considering work which pushes at the edges of this definition, and engages in an ongoing conversation about what is photographic. I think of some recent moments such as Sam Falls moving from (slightly) more traditional photographic techniques into sculptural works affected by time and light, which play with the elements of photography, or Sara Cwynar‚Äôs motion work building on the legacy of the pictures generation. I'm not suggesting we collect sculpture, but I suspect we will encounter work that is photographic in nature but references, responds to, or is dynamic with the blockchain, and this new market.

But I raise an eyebrow anytime I see an individual initiate a project and then collect that same project under a pseudonym. I do think it's a clever tactic on FND specifically, as it increases the likelihood of bidding wars, and home page features, but it's not without a certain cause for concern.  The reason I pointed it out was to make sure we were being realistic about the market data. I don't think auctions initiated by Fellowship, or by other founding members of Obscura - should really be taken into account when trying to determine market interest. I am sure they are collecting the pieces because they love them, and that is totally cool! My main point was just trying to be realistic about the organic market interest, vs. the market interest that appears on the surface due to founders buying their own project. 

It's sort of become common practice in the space, so I just think it's worth talking about and noticing. I do not think it means that we should discount the project at all. I LOVE the project and I would pick up a piece myself if I had the eth.

"661055944536621072","Zak_Krevitt#7060","2022-01-06","Hi Alex, thank you for taking the time to walk us through this all! It's really enlightening to see both your internal thought process, the logistics of the WWA project, and to hear your thoughts on the curation committee itself. 

On the committee structure, I definitely agree with you that collecting work from members could pose a conflict of interest, (either real, or imagined by the public) but I push back on the idea that being a photographer would make someone more prone to bad behavior. 

This same line of thinking would actually exclude anyone from ever being on the committee, because all of us here, whether an active photographer or not, have friends that are photographers. I would hope that we would have enough trust in each other so as not to assume that we would abuse this power, but in a trustless setting such as crypto, I do understand the caution. I think it would of course make sense to bar photographers from buying their own work through the dao.

I think that photographers in the space would have a broad sense of the market  (as we tend to obsessively watch each other), while also having an elevated idea of what makes a photograph special. Photographers spend thousands of hours scrutinizing their own work, researching photo history, and learning about curation, editing, and the cultural zeitgeist. I think that if the curation committee only ever existed of non-photographers, our collection might get a bit stale. 

If there is a vote that comes up, and it happens to be a close friend, I certainly think it would be appropriate to recuse oneself, as you mentioned doing (kudos to you btw!) - but, I don't think that is exclusive to photographers by any means. 

I actually see the inverse being more prevalent, potentially, as collectors would have much more financial incentive to collect the work of artists they have collected previously, in order to drive up value of their own collection. 

My point here is that there would be temptation for anyone, photographer, collector, etc. to pump the bags of themselves or their friends, so I don't see that making a distinction of 'photographer vs collector' to be a solid reasoning to keep photographers off the committee. 

Instead, I see them working together harmoniously to create a world class collection.

I would hope that any individual that joins the committee, regardless of positioning in the NFT community, does so in good faith and without ulterior motives.

Does this pose a problem as what should be bought and creates a limitation for the DAO? Yes it does. So what I and several other initial members suggested 4 months ago in the initial stages of the DAO was to have an advisory board external to the DAO that judges based on quality. This seems to not fit the DAO model so we need to find another way. Photographers in the voting room giving advise about the pieces and artists but not having power to vote seems like a good alternative.

If we are weighing possible corruption, collectors and professional crypto traders have far more to gain by being in control of the treasurery, than photographers do. I think the public would also see as much. 

I've already had people reach out to me, concerned about our acquisitions, because they have noticed an overlap in the Commitee member's prior personal aquistitsitons, and the acquisitions made for the dao. 

I really can't see any reason why they would think that about photographers being on the Commitee, that wouldn't also extend to collectors. 

The baseline assumption that photographers are so corrupt that they would only advise the acquisition of their friends is very disheartening and disappointing. 

I would think that a DAO this focused on photography, would have more faith in the integrity of photographers, and not make them out to be so insidious. 

Photographers have far less to gain by being on the Commitee than anyone else in the NFT ecosystem. 

If I was looking from the outside, and I learned photographers had zero voting power in our acquisitions, I would immediately disregard the validity of the project.","",""
