From my experience, some stuff resonates much better with photographers and some stuff resonates better with collectors and the broader public. We should try to optimize for the second group.

- keep the message simple. Like REALLY simple lol
- stuff like being part of Fortune's 50 most influential people in NFT resonates a lot more with the broader public than photography awards
- saying who collects her is better than saying where she's minting (this info doesn't add much value)

5) Maybe not a founding member but I think a member from RAW DAO to co host would be ideal.

6) I would suggest 3 spaces a week max? Would like feedback on this from others. But again I think it depends on the acquisition frequency.
