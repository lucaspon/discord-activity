I spent the past hour reading through the whole gov channel and some really great conversation happening. In terms of the first acquisition I think moving fast and making a big splash makes a lot of sense. It sends a strong signal to the overall crypto community and creates a foundational piece that we can start building around.","","üëç (4),üíØ (1)"

The New Community Photography Collection:
Will be formed of photographic work that is considered important by the community itself as a way to give voice to the values of this evolving community that we call the NFT world. The committee should take into account work that‚Äôs already in important collections of the NFT artworld and work that has been important for the short history of photography in the NFT space without discrimination of style, concept or formal approach . This collection will also be on the lookout for new work being produced and valued in the NFT world by creators and collectors alike and will have the objective of creating a record of the evolution of photography in this space, a collection that can become a marker for new cultural aesthetic values. **This is an outline","","üëç (1)"

The mechanics to acquire the pieces for either branch is what we are figuring out. Let‚Äôs say for example the list that we have now up for Vote: I would say 90% of the work would fall under the new community collection and 10% under legacy. 

Distinction between both: mainly origin space (NFT or traditional art world) of where the collection became know or had success in. 

These initial acquisitions are more of betting on a wide range of established names and also a balanced canvas of current actor of the NFT space.

"136080034585640961","Shira#9662","2021-12-02","Hey guys

Let me share what's on my head. Please read this with caution, but knowing that I was introduced to photography through NFTs, so probably **I need to be educated** about a lot of photography concepts.

We need to think strategically about our curation. We need to have a goal, or at least a signature/thesis to hold.

**For each piece/collection, the info we have is:**
- market price
- supply
- volume
- opinions from our collectors and artists

When we decide to buy a piece we are telling a story. And the story is basically or ""I think the market is undervaluing this piece"" or ""I can create future value for this piece if I own it"". Intuitively, I think we do this all the time, but when we are doing this is a committee, **this needs to be explicit for us to communicate and decide as a group.**

So in my mind, the decision to acquire blue chip artworks now is to:
- create a core collection that will leverage our brand/respect as a collector
- create some resilience in our assets value
- avoid mistakes until we learn how to do this

For this reason, my bias (regarding the blue chips) would be avoid collections/artists that have very low supply or volume as well, at least for now.","","üëç (6)"
"136080034585640961","Shira#9662","2021-12-02","Ok, now for the other works we're gonna acquire (not the blue chips), I think the main goals could be:
- to extract future value, finding undervalued gems  (and tbh we need to respect the market. If an artist is not selling, we should know/research why, before considering something a hidden gem)
- educate/guide the market (if we understand that this is the case)
- educate/guide the artist 
- diversification (styles, narratives, audiences) This is debatable, since we can narrow things down if we define a specific domain to work with.
- research and innovation. Each buy we do we send a message to the market. We need to collect the feedback and understand if our choices are making any difference. We can also introduce new styles and artists to the market through our collection, testing some boundaries.

All in all, our ultimate goal here is to understand the market better than the other participants. And then this becomes easy.","","üëç (7)"

An adherence to a traditional form or mode of operating (""documentary"" as an example) is actually quite a dated view of photography, which is itself a technological medium, always evolving. And a lot of women artists have historically and continue to actually move the medium forward through experimentation. I'm actually quite passionate about this and have written and spoken a lot on the topic of the inability of photography to be a document. Instead, the more accurate description is post-documentary or documentary aesthetic (which acknowledges that the camera is subjective by virtue of the photographer).","","ü§ù (1)"

- From a pure investment perspective, 8eth seems a little high given the first piece from the same …®’º  ç…õ ç÷Ö Ä…®«ü ç collection has been listed on Foundation with a 5e reserve since Sep with no takers: https://foundation.app/@dianaesinclair/~/90050. Her highest sale on there was 6eth but it was a partnership with IXSHELLS who now commands big prices. She's sold 1 piece on SR for 5e (I personally prefer this one: https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/dare-i-dream-in-melanin-29493).

- From a curatorial perspective, I'm not the best person to answer whether this sits close enough to the community's expectation of what investing in 'photography' really means or the viewpoint we as the CC want to stand by on this topic. I do think this is a question we should strive to answer though, but maybe we don't need to force it and it'll come organically through discussions like this.

- From a personal perspective, when I saw …®’º  ç…õ ç÷Ö Ä…®«ü ç: #001, whilst it's not necessarily what I'd usually go for, I'd have pulled the trigger if the reserve was a bit lower. I'd absolutely love us to support artists like Diana.

I spent the last two days trying to come up with a mental model for this initial capital deployment / acquisition phase. Before I jump into my rationale / suggestion I want to say that I‚Äôm not a photography expert nor an experienced collector. My journey in art started with NFT / FingerprintsDAO (‚ÄúFP‚Äù) and in this rationale I will try to relate what happened in this short journey and what I think we can make happen together, as a DAO. 

All the below are just personal ideas / thoughts, I don‚Äôt know if other FPs members here share same vision. 

Apologies in advance if it is just a big trip from my mind.

**FingerprintsDAO** 

Probably you all know the story behind FP, but here we go again: 
‚Ä¢    20 Autoglyphs (AGs) with rarities from #1 to #7, amounting to 4% of the total supply. It‚Äôs the 3rd largest Autoglyph collection in the world.
‚Ä¢    Collection was assembled by a small group of people led by @DT | Luiz  and @Shira .
‚Ä¢    Thesis: @DT | Luiz  ‚ÄúTier-1 NFTs, denominated in ETH, should outperform ETH itself as the Ethereum economy grows‚Äù.  
‚Ä¢    Historical / Art Significance: at that time when we looked at the tier-1 collections, CryptoPunks stood out. CryptoPunks than would be an obvious choice. But there‚Äôs something above Punks. A smaller collection that the average Punk owner can barely afford, with a similar (or higher) historical significance and the same provenance: Autoglyphs.

Instead of making a straight forward acquisition and enjoying its price appreciation only, FP managed to create more value by levering in the community that got bigger around AG, Punks, Larva Labs., while creating its own community. 

AG prices increase by 8x, FP token value increased in a multiple of it (100x).","","üöÄ (3),ü§© (3),lp_fuego (3)"
"827362797792788520","hddamico#7928","2021-12-03","**TF #49 / RAWDAO**
First sale: T40 sold for USD 35,280. 

Second sale: @DT | Luiz  buys it for USD 506 ETH ‚Äì just weeks after the First Sale

Third sale: RAW DAO sells it for USD 850,420 

We could spend a life debating what were the factors that made this stellar trajectory to happen, in addition to Justin‚Äôs talent / art. One thing that I know for sure tho, is that in this Third Sale, RAW DAO was capable in leverage on: 

‚Ä¢    Justin‚Äôs community 
‚Ä¢    DT‚Äôs community 
‚Ä¢    Fingerprints'' community 
‚Ä¢    Founding artists' communities 
‚Ä¢    RAW DAO recently born community 

All this to say: we must make the most of this very first acquisition set. 

**We are not a gallery, we are not a museum, we are not a big collector. We are a DAO. The sum of communities. If our goal is to increase our token value over time and have the best collection over this decade, we must do better than buying awesome photography.** 

RAW DAO Token Value: Collected pieces, Curation power and Community. If we to it well, one year from now our token value should be multiples of our collection value. 

If in the future $RAW = Collected pieces, we are fund not a DAO. 

Suggestion: focus in leveraging third parties‚Äô community to create the biggest community. For the next acquisitions phases we should **recalibrate it to a more curatorial / strict approach**.","",""
"827362797792788520","hddamico#7928","2021-12-03","**1)**    Acquire Artists with big community and leverage on it
a.    i.e. Drifter, Reuben Wu, etc.
b.    To me, big communities check the boxes on trading volume, secondary market and other metrics. I don‚Äôt know big communities around photographers with no secondary sales.  
c.    3 pieces 
d.    80 ETH
e.    Give $RAW tokens ‚Äì in addition to ETH - to the artist and structure a marketing strategy to smartly announce the acquisition. The goal is to add their community to ours. 

**2)**    Acquire Artists with some community, good work, yet to see price appreciation as occurred in 1.
a.    i.e. Ben Zank, Chad, Claudia, someone from Asia with complete different follower / collector base, etc. Diversified narratives. 
b.    All pieces under 3 ETH 
c.    Acquire 3-5 pieces from each artists 
d.    Announce it after the communities from the big artist are acquainted and hopefully supportive of RAW.
e.    Strategy: reprice collections of all these artists by providing clear signal to the market. If this happen, even without RAW membership, those artists will become our fans. 
f.    RAW may sell 2-3 from each artists or even fractionalize it to raise more funds, and keep 1-2 in a more permanent piece.    

**At this point our community ($RAW value) should be a sum of: RAW (FP, DT, Justin, Founding Artists) + 1 + 2.**

I'm trying to get some data do help us analyze artists that would fit into **Category 1** 

My idea would be to pay the best ETH price we can and give them 500-1000 $RAW if they agree with our PR / Marketing Strategy. 

Ideally we need someone expert in social media / content creation to help us here (i.e. if we decide to move fwd with Drift would be great if RAW Twitter posts a picture of a Vans, while Drift posts something related to us.. like building momentum..) 

As a game plan, I would suggest that we first decide what to do in **Category 1** and after that we go for the **Category 2**. 

Please let me know what you think, what other data analytics we should care, and if you have more indications for this category.","","üôå (2)"

o    Lux Noctis is an ongoing project depicting landscapes unbound by time and space, influenced by ideas of planetary exploration, chiaroscuro painting, and science fiction. We are overwhelmed everyday by beautiful images of the familiar. I imagine these scenes transformed into undiscovered landscapes which renew our perceptions of our world. Lux Noctis is an acclaimed series of photographs held in the permanent collections of The Guggenheim, the Met Museum, and the MoMA, and has been published in Time Magazine, National Geographic Magazine, and Wired.

o    A testament to impermanence, an ephemeral landscape in constant flux, and the act of memorialising its image for generations to come, through the medium of photography. While my practice as a whole aims to reveal hidden meanings on a geologic time scale, this artwork shows a snapshot of a kinetic landscape which no longer exists in this form.

Where My Vans Go is a collection comprised of 115 iconic images created over the span of three years exploring all over the United States. From coast to coast, between borders and beyond, this series represents the journey that has forged the person and artist that I am today. By following my vans on this vast journey through time, I hope you will feel every step and heartbeat, I hope you will rise above fears with me. If this journey has taught me anything it is that everything is about our struggle and process, if you never climb, you never see the view. This is the climb. In snow and fog, sunshine and rain, from the tops of skyscrapers and bridges and through incarceration, here I learned to do whatever it takes. These are the shoes that made me. Welcome.

The word ""best"" is a difficult one for me here, because it's a qualifier signifying quality of work. My (perhaps incorrect, so please do correct me if I'm misinterpreting) is that this proposes we want to create the most financially valuable collection in the NFT space fairly quickly. The one thing I think we miss out on if quality of work becomes secondary is really cultivating ""the best"" space for NFT photography, one that does value aesthetics, conceptual approach, actually bringing value to the space through a curatorial vision of what is good.","",""

**Thesis: **:buy tier-1 NFT pieces from artists with strong community. 2-3 artists. give them RAW tokens so incentives are aligned in make a great community together. 

*Strong community means: social media, notable collectors and relevant sales volume*

**Goal**: NAV appreciation + add community to RAW + awareness + credentials. Catalyze it for the Cat 2 artists

**Cat 2**

**Thesis: **: great photographers lacking community. 6-8 artists. 3-5 pieces from each. we can add some of Founding Artists, not only because they are great but to reinforce our community as well (we discussed it in the past). 

**Goal**: NAV appreciation + assembly the best collection of the decade + recycle capital buy selling 1-2 pieces from the 3-5 pieces we are buying. 

*i.e. imagine we buy Chad for 1.0 ETH, after all the Cat 1 announcements and our Cat 2 acquisition announcements his collection gets to a 4ETH floor, we could fractionalize the piece (RAW members only) @ a ""below floor"" price, called it 2 ETH, make a 2x profit while selling something great to our community. win win win*","",""

- For the specific piece, that's more subjective - we think it's a grail and therefore worth paying a premium. I understand the arguments against this too, a safer option would be the 5e piece on Foundation.

- Community: a leading voice (freehawaii was smart), 186k Insta, 31k Twitter

I do think it‚Äôs extremely important to include a women in the first set of cat 1 acquisitions. I know that we had a discussion about it before and not everyone agrees, but with the current massive unbalanced in diversity with regards to sales to have only male blue chip large acquisitions will cause backlash and not the kind we want. And besides that we should be on the forefront of setting the bar on diversity since we have a powerful position to do so. I agree that 10eth on Diana‚Äôs piece may be steep now but I see her adding a lot of value down the line. I also much prefer that if we go with her we select a pure photography piece. Being collected by RAW will send very strong signals too. 

I‚Äôve always had an issue with looking at secondary sales as a metric - a lot of photographers including myself have a strong collector base of serious üíéüôå and there just isn‚Äôt a lot of movement / flipping with their work. I wouldn‚Äôt want to judge Diana‚Äôs future growth potential on this metric, but instead on her community involvement and her investment in the space which I think speaks volumes in itself. 

I think my concern with optics on diversity may be eased by asking this question: I know we aren‚Äôt making the categories public as this is strictly internal metric to help us make decisions we can back, and I‚Äôm on board with that! Are we going to announce cat 1 and 2 together? Or are we announcing the large acquisitions first? If we‚Äôre announcing it together then my concern around diversity would be a bit more at ease if we have a lot of balance and diversity within cat 2. However if we‚Äôre going ahead with cat 1 first and announcing I personally would feel extremely uncomfortable by it just being men if we don‚Äôt have women in there. Im very loud about diversity so at the risk of sounding like a broken record I don‚Äôt think this should be overlooked.","","fire (2),üëç (2),üíØ (1)"

After carefully reading members considerations around strategy and nominations I would like to present next steps to our game plan.

Background / thesis: 
RAW DAO is responsible for leading a huge cultural movement.  I would like to reinforce that we should not act as a regular collector or have an oversimplified framework.
Having said that I would suggest we go ahead with Drift and Diana (Phase 1 artists). 

**Why Drift?** huge fan base, notable collectors, relevant market indicators (volume / collection size / ‚Äúcollectible‚Äù appeal). **20 ETH**

**Why Diana?** Super talented, information asymmetry, Justin and other members have strong conviction around her, clear sign of RAW supporting diversity (young black woman artist).  **10 ETH **

Not sure if Reuben would add much value to our community / engagement. Also, he doesn‚Äôt have pieces in a structured collection, hard to imagine that it will accrue much more value over time. We can do lot  a better with 33 ETH by collecting artists from Phase 2.  

Phase 1 is largely driven on RAW values and community building. I don‚Äôt expect that our movement will trigger more new collectors and increase prices for these collections, something that I do expect for Phase 2 artists.

- Process: love the rigour @hddamico is bringing to our overall strategy and decision making process, thank you! I like the structured approach and am happy to add my votes once the shortlist is finalised.

- Grayson: I grabbed these for the DAO as I thought they were good investments and the window of opportunity would close before we could officially pull the trigger. I did so fully aware it was out of any official scope so am absolutely fine if the DAO wants them or not. Happy to indefinitely hold them too if they make sense for a later phase - it's all good either way, just let me know.

- Matt Porter's The Heights: They're sold out, I'm holding some but I asked Carlo and he'd sell one of his for 2e. There are probably easier collections to pick up 3-5 pieces from but I'm a big fan of this collection.

- Daniel Gordon: I'd also add this to the list but noted on @justinaversano.eth's comment we're heavy on Assembly so maybe it doesn't make sense: https://opensea.io/collection/danielgordon-portraitstudio

- Collections vs 1/1s: I'd also like to note that whilst structured collections are currently where the action is at, let's not sleep on 1/1s. There are a few photographers that have show decent price progression with limited (On SR: Guido 2.5e>20e, 5e>20e Cath Simard, on Foundation plenty of examples) and the same could be said for other 1/1 art (Xcopy being the obvious example).

On the collectors: I still it‚Äôs relevant nonetheless as it helps paint a picture of their ecosystem though it shouldn‚Äôt have as much as weight as Cat 1, I would say the same for IRL reputation, great to know if artists have gallery experience etc but it should less relevant in cat 2 onwards (lots of photographers didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt or at least haven‚Äôt yet had access to this regardless how incredible their work is) hopefully we can help change that!

"869997214221623296","foto.eth#8472","2021-12-08","thanks, everyone for the call! I am still a little confused on the advisory function. I understand reasoning behind the artists in this committee not voting, but are we putting together the list of works that the collectors will vote on, or are collectors also nominating (and thus the list the artists assembled could ultimately be not acted on)? I ask not only for understanding our role currently, but for articulating it strategically to future artists going forward. I worry future artists on this committee will feel they are simply being involved in a performative way if their role is not clearly defined and clearly valuable to the process. My saying all this is informed by own running of a non-profit and the cumbersome nature of advisory committees from a community-building standpoint. To outline the options I see: the artist advisory committee either 1) creates the nominated listed of artists up for acquisition and vote by the collector committee or 2) is a voice that articulates their ideas without any certain action resulting from them (we essentially hope that we provide insight from an artistic perspective that can guide the collector vote). Whichever way the consensus is on this function it just needs to be communicated in a motivating, compelling fashion","","üëç (1)"

"827362797792788520","hddamico#7928","2021-12-08","today we decided

we are collecting one piece from Drift and one piece from Diana
we are collecting 9 additional artists - 5 founding members and 4 ""non RAW"" artists
we need to work closely to the marketing / PR team and create  state of the art contents when announcing acquisitions: tweets, spaces and etc. @michelleviljoen.eth and @hddamico will be responsible for that. 

next steps

@justinaversano.eth to get a final ok from Diana and check if she is down to join the forces as to announcing the acquisition/PR. 
@Shira talk to Drift. @Curation Committee to decide which piece we are collecting. 
@lucaspon @hddamico to set up a vault for all acquisitions
@Curation Committee to continue sending and assessing names for the phase 2. i would recommend tha we use Notion for that. @foto.eth tks for kicking this off. 

ideally we can finish the phase 1 acquisitions this week. announce it / start educating people about it during the next week, while we structure and execute phase 2.

sounds like a plan?","","‚úÖ (8),‚ùå (1)"

Hi Zac! I think this an important point to discuss, so thank you for raising it. I think it‚Äôs important to focus on the eth and not the fiat. It may not come naturally but that‚Äôs at least how I personally see it - the NFT movement is transcending what we are used to in the traditional world and I embrace it. We as a curation committee have had in-depth discussions about each one of the pieces we collect, taking into consideration the artists career within Web3, the significance of their work, the quality of their work and what we believe their potential future value will hold. We believe that each piece and artist that RAW collects has a strong future in Web 3 and that their work and careers will only appreciate in value. We will be collecting from photographers in all phases of their careers, these larger acquisitions, in combination with collecting from an array of other photographer backed by the RAW DAO will ultimately uplift all photographers collected and help build a healthy and more fair ecosystem.","",""

I think no matter the decisions from this committee and future committees we would always have some level of push back or unhappy members but having a clear reasoning for our choices and addressing these points of possible conflict right as we announce is def going to be better than justifying after being asked. 

Like @alexcartagenamex said the community esp in photography is relatively small, and the group of photographers and collectors who are involved in most of these organizations overlap because of that. (It‚Äôs the same movers and shakers building many of these). I believe that as the space grows and others become more confident this would level out! 

We need to make it very clear that artists do not vote on themselves, and that members recuse themselves. We should also address the founding artists being collected for sure, however in the bigger scheme the majority of photographers collected is not founding members so at least it‚Äôs not top heavy. But will for sure need to be addressed!","","üíØ (3),ü§ù (1)"

the idea behind phase 2 / founding artists:

1) send a signal to the market that our founding artists are ‚Äútier 1‚Äù photographers in the space 

2) be the lighthouse for collectors to ‚Äúcopy‚Äù our move (this builds community)

with regards to 2 i question myself if given the chosen artists / available collections we are going to be capable of achieving it.

that is why i tried to push for more data analysis / strategy before voting. 

for Claudia, 0.45 ETH floor collection, maybe yes, but there are few pieces. 

for Carlos, the price seems bit high. 

again, trying to make this move acting like a DAO, not a regular collector.

I share this concern because the premise of kicking off secondaries was pretty fundamental to the explanation of our curatorial approach. Yet now, a lot of the work we've selected simply won't benefit from that, especially the work that is transferred and not sold. Is there a way to amend this at this point, or are we too far down the acquisition pipeline? This seems like a pretty big deal to me and perhaps wasn't considered enough in the selection process. I suggest in the future, it actually be a column on the nominations doc that simply proposes - will the dao supporting this artist lead to a measurable increase in collecting this work? At the end of the day, if the dao's collection is meant to 1) grow in value over time by way of 2) acting as a market signal that others should collect work, increasing its value and movement in secondaries, then i think that needs to really be built into the strategy more concretely moving forward.","",""

- Julie is very well-established IRL (if we're hedging our bets with having a few artists who are more emerging and some very established). I've worked with her for many years in my prior role and respect her immensely as well as her work. Very classic images of childhood and family. I do think 4-8 ETH is high to really make an impact on secondaries - very curious what other collectors think on that. 
- Same goes for Matt with secondary prices unless we get in a private sale from a collector, but there's not much potential for market signaling there if we do that, right? 
- MCB: I think this has signaling potential. He's very respected IRL - used to be with Magnum, but I don't think he still is..not sure what happened there. He is approaching an often-cliche topic (outsiders going into Cuba to photograph...often romanticizing the country despite the reality of the political situation) in a much more nuanced way. 
- Amy: I wish there was more left on primary in this collection so it could be a bigger signal; she's very emerging in the real art world sense and the NFT sense, for what that's worth, and I think she has very beautiful images and is dealing with a topic that we haven't seen much yet in this space - motherhood. That said, I don't think the work is particularly strong conceptually. But, I voted for this work and still would support it.","",""

Luiz Braga, M / Brazilian / Late-Career.

1) Increase in the collection's relevance, visibility, and entry into the traditional market (via established institutions or by attracting traditional collectors);

2) Potential for valuing the work with the possible movement from the traditional market to the universe of crypto, since Luiz's works are being marketed today at a cheaper price than usual and/or with the increased interest of collectors in legacy photographers

3) Style diversification

4) Luiz made his first sale to an Asian collector because of the new medium, NFT.
