I think it could be a cool idea to have an internal podcast. It would primarily give insight to the backgrounds of our core artists and curators, through short 1-1 interviews. It could also serve as a way to talk about collections (after we collect them) and the though process from the curatorial committee as to why they thought that collection would be important. 

I‚Äôve spoken with a few people who are on twitter, who are full members, and excited about the DAO but simply don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to be a part of the discord. I think this can also act as a medium to keep them in the loop. 

Flamingo DAO and Shopify have something similar. 

I have experience podcasting, interviewing, hosting files, and uploading to iTunes/Spotify. *The idea would be to keep them short, like 30 min tops.* 

I think it could be a really good way to build community.","","‚ú® (9)"

What solutions do we have:
1. discord:
   - already using it, but can we make it more visible to members?
   - the announcements channel shouldn't be private, so we can ping members about everything that matters? Keeping it public - we won't be able to do announcements for votes & o on
   - we can add events directly to discord, not 100% visible, but you can set a reminder when/if you see it

2. twitter
   - one of the best ping tools if using twitter is mobile notification ON; I would advise users to install the app on mobile (if they don't have it) and turn on the mobile notifications
   - if the main twitter account might be too crowded with different messages, should we do a private twitter account where we allow access just to members? this way if someone has mobile notifications ON for this account they will be able to receive push messages on mobile for only the most important things (votes, plans, urgent action, etc)

3. SMS
   - this is amazing as a msg delivery tool, but it's not anonymous or compatible with web3

4. telegram read-only group with notifications?
 
5. RAWdao mobile app +  push notifications

6. SHARED CALENDAR  - already using this

I tried looking for this in discord and found this info in General and members lounge channel. And probably that's why I missed it, there is a lot happening there. Maybe we can create a separate channel just for announcement of acquisitions? It's a base value of our DAO so the info could be more visible!","","üëç (2)"

Just thinking out loud, probably it's not necessary right now","",""
